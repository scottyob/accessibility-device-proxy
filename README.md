accessibility-device
====================

accessibility-device proxy for assisted development on Android simulators.  See more about the project on the project website.

The Android simulator unfortunantly does not simulate a Bluetooth stack.  This project requires bluetoooth connectivity to the Arduino board which makes development and testing very hard.  This proxy service has two options.  It can act as a simple TCP proxy to forward packets from a website (using websockets) or serial on the host computer to the Arduino device.



usage
====================
ToDo:  Figure out how one should use this app and put usage here.
